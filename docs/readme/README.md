## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x
2. Virtual environment (venv)
3. Git (for version control)
4. Terminal/Command Prompt
5. Code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Faraday-AI/Faraday-AI.git
   cd Faraday-AI
   ```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Server
1. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. Access points:
   - Main URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000
   - API documentation: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
   - Alternative docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc
   - Landing page: http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/index.html

### Environment Setup

#### Local Development Setup
To set up your local development environment to match production:

1. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup_local.sh  # Make the script executable
   ./setup_local.sh         # Run the setup script
   ```

The setup script:
- Sets PYTHONPATH to `/app` to match production
- Creates necessary directories (models, static, logs, exports)
- Sets up symlinks for static files
- Sets appropriate permissions

#### Import Paths
The project uses absolute import paths with `/app/` notation. This is configured to work in both production and local development:

- Production: Configured through Docker and Render settings
- Local: Configured through the setup script

The imports in the codebase use `app.` notation (e.g., `from app.main import app`). This is intentional and matches the production environment.

#### Production Environment
In production (Render):
- PYTHONPATH is set to `/app` in the Dockerfile
- Static files are served from `/static/`
- A symlink is created from `/app/static` to `/static/`

## Project Structure
- `app/`: Main application code, including API endpoints and services
  - `app/main.py`: Core FastAPI application and endpoint definitions
  - `app/services/realtime_collaboration_service.py`: Real-time collaboration implementation
- `app/core/`: Core functionalities and configurations
- `app/services/`: Service layer for business logic
- `app/models/`: Data models and schemas
- `app/static/`: Static files and landing page
- `tests/`: Test files for unit and integration testing
- `docs/`: Documentation and guides

## Features

docker exec -it faraday-ai-app-1 python -m pytest tests/test_analytics_phase3.py::TestAnalyticsAPIEndpoints -v
```

### Collaboration Feature Testing
```bash
# Create a session
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/collaboration/create?session_id=test-session&user_id=user1"

# Share a document
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/collaboration/share_document?session_id=test-session&user_id=user1&document_id=doc1&document_type=text"

# Lock and edit document
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/collaboration/lock?session_id=test-session&user_id=user1&document_id=doc1"
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/collaboration/edit_document?session_id=test-session&user_id=user1&document_id=doc1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "Updated content"}'
```

## Current Limitations
1. In-memory storage (data lost on restart)
2. Basic authentication system
3. Limited error handling
4. No conflict resolution for concurrent edits

## Future Enhancements
1. Persistent storage (database implementation)
2. Enhanced authentication system
3. Improved error handling
4. Conflict resolution system
5. Document diff tracking
6. User presence indicators
