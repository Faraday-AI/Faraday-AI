## Project Overview
Faraday AI is an intelligent educational platform that leverages AI to provide personalized learning experiences. The platform combines adaptive learning paths, real-time progress tracking, and AI-powered resource recommendations to optimize the learning journey for each user.

## Core Components

### 1. Learning Management
- **LearningProgress Service**: Tracks and analyzes user learning patterns
- **DifficultyPredictor**: Dynamically adjusts content difficulty based on user performance
- **Knowledge Graph**: Structured representation of educational topics and their relationships
- **Adaptive Learning Paths**: Generates personalized learning sequences

### 2. AI Components
- **Resource Recommender**: AI-powered system for suggesting learning materials
- **ChatGPT Integration**: Provides intelligent tutoring and answers
- **Educational Context Engine**: Contextualizes AI responses for education
- **Performance Analytics**: ML-based analysis of user progress

### 3. Gamification
- **Achievement System**: Rewards learning milestones
- **Streak Tracking**: Encourages consistent engagement
- **Tier System**: Progressive rewards (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond)
- **Recovery Mode**: Helps users maintain progress after breaks

### 4. API Endpoints

#### Learning Endpoints
```
GET  /learning/progress/{user_id}     - Get learning progress
POST /learning/progress              - Update learning progress
GET  /learning/difficulty/{user_id}   - Get difficulty predictions
