# Model Directory Restructuring Guide

## Current Structure
Currently, models are located in multiple locations with the following organization:

### Model Locations
1. `/app/models/` - Main models directory
2. `/app/models/physical_education/` - Physical education specific models
3. `/app/api/v1/models/` - API models
4. `/app/services/physical_education/models/` - Service models

### Files to Consolidate

#### Activity Models
- `/app/models/activity.py`
- `/app/api/v1/models/activity.py`
- `/app/models/physical_education/activity/activity_plan.py`
- `/app/services/physical_education/models/activity_types.py`

#### Student Models
- `/app/models/student.py`
- `/app/services/physical_education/models/student_types.py`
- `/app/services/physical_education/student_manager.py`

#### Class Models
- `/app/models/class_.py`
- `/app/services/physical_education/models/class_.py`
- `/app/services/physical_education/models/class_types.py`

#### Routine Models
- `/app/models/routine.py`
- `/app/models/physical_education/routine/routine.py`
- `/app/services/physical_education/models/routine.py`
- `/app/models/physical_education/routine/routine_types.py`
- `/app/models/physical_education/routine/routine_performance.py`

#### Assessment Models
- `/app/models/assessment.py`
- `/app/models/physical_education/assessment/assessment.py`
- `/app/services/physical_education/models/skill_assessment/skill_assessment.py`
- `/app/models/physical_education/assessment/assessment_types.py`

#### Safety Models
- `/app/models/safety.py`
- `/app/models/physical_education/safety/safety.py`
- `/app/services/physical_education/models/safety.py`
- `/app/models/physical_education/safety/safety_types.py`

## Required Changes

1. **Directory Restructuring**
   - Move all models from various locations to `/app/models/`
   - Consolidate related models into single files where appropriate
   - Remove redundant model definitions
   - Create `__init__.py` in new models directory with proper exports

2. **Import Path Updates Required In**:
   - All service files in `app/services/physical_education/`
   - All test files in `tests/physical_education/`
   - All seed data scripts in `app/scripts/seed_data/`
   - Any API routes using these models
   - Update all relative imports to absolute imports
   - Update all `from app.models.physical_education` to `from app.models`

3. **Model Relationships to Preserve**
   - Student -> Class (through ClassStudent)
   - Activity -> Category (through ActivityCategoryAssociation)
   - Routine -> Activity (through RoutineActivity)
   - Student -> Activity (through various performance and progress models)
   - Safety incidents linking to multiple entities
   - Equipment checks and maintenance history
   - Assessment relationships with students and activities
   - All SQLAlchemy relationship() definitions must be preserved exactly

4. **Special Considerations**
   - Maintain all existing table names and relationships
   - Preserve all enum definitions
   - Keep existing database constraints
   - Ensure circular imports are avoided
   - Maintain type hints and pydantic models
   - Preserve all table_args and __table_args__
   - Keep all Column definitions exactly as they are
   - Maintain all cascade delete settings
   - Preserve all index definitions
   - Keep all foreign key constraints

## Migration Steps

1. **Preparation**
   - Create backup of current state
   - Create new `/app/models/` directory structure
   - Create `__init__.py` with proper exports

2. **Model Consolidation Order**
   a. Base Models and Types
      - Create `base.py` for shared base classes
      - Create `types.py` for all enum types
   
   b. Core Models
      - Consolidate `activity.py`
      - Consolidate `student.py`
      - Consolidate `class_.py`
   
   c. Supporting Models
      - Consolidate `routine.py`
      - Consolidate `assessment.py`
      - Consolidate `safety.py`
      - Consolidate `exercise.py`

3. **Update Dependencies**
   - Update import paths in all dependent files
   - Test each file after modification
   - Update imports one module at a time
   - Verify no circular dependencies are created

4. **Testing and Verification**
   - Run all tests after each model consolidation
   - Verify database migrations work
   - Test API endpoints
   - Run seed data scripts
   - Check relationship cascades
   - Verify business logic
   - Test validation rules
   - Check import paths
   - Verify no circular dependencies
   - Ensure all models are properly exported

5. **Cleanup**
   - Remove old files only after all tests pass
   - Clean up `__pycache__` directories
   - Update documentation
   - Remove old directories

## Current Dependencies

The models are heavily used in:
- Safety management system
- Activity scheduling and tracking
- Student performance monitoring
- Class management
- Equipment maintenance
- Risk assessment
- Health monitoring
- API endpoints and routes
- Database migrations
- Seed data scripts
- Test fixtures

## Database Considerations
- All models use SQLAlchemy ORM
- Many models include Pydantic schemas for API validation
- Several models use JSON/JSONB fields for flexible data storage
- Existing migrations must remain valid
- All table names must stay exactly the same
- All column definitions must remain unchanged
- All indexes must be preserved
- All constraints must be maintained
- All relationship cascades must work the same way

## Testing Requirements
- Maintain all existing test coverage
- Ensure all model relationships work as before
- Verify API endpoints still function correctly
- Check all seed data scripts still work
- Run full test suite after each major change
- Verify all database migrations still work
- Test all CRUD operations on each model
- Verify all relationship cascades work
- Check all validation rules still apply
- Ensure all business logic remains intact

## Critical Files to Update
- `app/core/database.py`
- `app/core/config.py`
- `app/api/deps.py`
- All files in `app/services/physical_education/`
- All files in `tests/physical_education/`
- All files in `app/scripts/seed_data/`
- All API route files
- All migration files
- All test fixtures
- All service initialization files

## Verification Steps
1. Run all tests after each model consolidation
2. Verify database migrations work
3. Test API endpoints
4. Run seed data scripts
5. Check relationship cascades
6. Verify business logic
7. Test validation rules
8. Check import paths
9. Verify no circular dependencies
10. Ensure all models are properly exported
11. Test service integration
12. Verify metrics collection
13. Check security measures
14. Test caching system
15. Verify rate limiting
16. Check circuit breakers

This restructuring includes a comprehensive service layer implementation while preserving all existing functionality.
