# Docker Build Debug Documentation

## Current Status
- Docker build is stuck at initial stages
- Multiple attempts to resolve have been unsuccessful
- Docker Desktop was recently updated
- No containers are currently running
- Docker version: Latest (after update)
- Working directory verified: `/Users/joemartucci/Projects/New Faraday Cursor/Faraday-AI`

## Recent Progress
1. Directory Structure Verification:
   - Confirmed working directory is `/Users/joemartucci/Projects/New Faraday Cursor/Faraday-AI`
   - Verified all operations are being performed in the correct Faraday-AI directory
   - No files have been created or modified outside the designated directory
   - Established strict directory rules and protocols

2. Model Inheritance Fixes:
   - Resolved MRO (Method Resolution Order) issues in model files
   - Updated `environmental.py` to use `EnvironmentalBaseModel`
   - Updated `goal_setting.py` to use `GoalBaseModel`
   - Changed from multiple inheritance to single inheritance pattern
   - Fixed SQLAlchemy mapping issues
   - Documented model relationship changes

3. Docker Build Attempts:
   - Full rebuild with `./run.sh --rebuild`
   - Individual service builds attempted
   - Used `COMPOSE_BAKE=true` for optimization
   - Performed Docker system cleanup
   - Force stopped and restarted Docker Desktop
   - Verified Docker daemon status
   - Checked system resources
   - Validated network connectivity

4. Environment Configuration:
   - Verified database connection settings
   - Checked Redis configuration
   - Validated MinIO settings
   - Confirmed environment variables
   - Tested service communication
   - Verified port availability

5. Documentation Updates:
   - Added explicit rules for file operations
   - Documented strict requirements for working within Faraday-AI directory
   - Established protocol for getting explicit approval before any file changes
   - Created comprehensive debugging documentation
   - Added detailed error tracking
   - Documented build attempts and results

## Error Messages Encountered
1. Initial MRO Error:
   ```
   sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: Class <class 'app.models.environmental.EnvironmentalCondition'> has multiple mapped bases: [<class 'app.models.base.MetadataModel'>, <class 'app.models.base.AuditableModel'>, <class 'app.models.base.ValidatableModel'>]
   ```

2. Build Process Errors:
   ```
   Building 3887.7s (9/41) docker:desktop-linux
   => WARN: FromAsCasing: 'as' and 'FROM' keywords' casing do not match (line 2)
   ```

3. Docker Compose Warnings:
   ```
   WARN[0003] /Users/joemartucci/Projects/New Faraday Cursor/Faraday-AI/docker-compose.yml: the attribute `version` is obsolete, it will be ignored, please remove it to avoid potential confusion
   ```

## Current Issues
1. Docker commands are hanging:
   - `docker-compose down` hangs
   - `docker system prune` hangs
   - `docker info` hangs
   - Build process gets stuck at "Stopping running containers..."

2. Warning Messages:
   ```
   WARN[0003] /Users/joemartucci/Projects/New Faraday Cursor/Faraday-AI/docker-compose.yml: the attribute `version` is obsolete, it will be ignored, please remove it to avoid potential confusion
   ```

## Next Steps
1. System Restart:
   - Completely quit Docker Desktop (Cmd+Q)
   - Restart computer
   - Start Docker Desktop
   - Wait for full initialization

2. Initial Checks:
   ```bash
   # Verify Docker is running
   docker version
   
   # Check for any lingering containers
   docker ps -a
   
   # Clean up any remaining resources
   docker system prune -af --volumes
   ```

3. Build Process:
   ```bash
   # Set build optimization
   export COMPOSE_BAKE=true
   
   # Run the build script
   ./run.sh --rebuild
   ```

4. If Build Still Fails:
   - Try building services individually:
     ```bash
     docker-compose build --no-cache app
     docker-compose build --no-cache pe-video-processor
     docker-compose build --no-cache pe-movement-analyzer
     ```
   - Check Docker logs:
     ```bash
     docker logs
     ```

## Important Notes
- All files must be in Faraday-AI directory
- No files should be created without explicit approval
- No files should be moved without explicit approval
- No files should be edited in wrong locations
- No nested files should be created
- No packages/dependencies should be removed without approval
- No large code sections should be replaced without approval
- No files should be created/edited in workspace or root directory
- No duplicate files should be created
- No files should be moved between directories without approval
- Model inheritance issues have been resolved
- Docker build issues need to be addressed
- Service integration needs to be verified
- Environment variables need to be validated
