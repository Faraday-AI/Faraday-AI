## Remaining Tasks

1. **Additional Services to Complete**
   - Research Support GPT
   - Social Emotional Learning GPT
   - Virtual Reality Learning GPT
   - Augmented Reality Learning GPT
   - Collaborative Learning GPT
   - Adaptive Learning GPT
   - Content Generation GPT
   - Learning Analytics GPT
   - Educational Games GPT
   - Data Analysis GPT
   - Accessibility Support GPT

2. **Integration Requirements**
   - Ensure all new service pages have proper links in the main services navigation
   - Verify all internal links are working correctly
   - Add any missing "Try It" buttons or interactive elements
   - Implement consistent error handling for "Coming Soon" features

3. **Documentation Needs**
   - Create service documentation for new integrations
   - Update service inventory documentation
   - Add API documentation for new services
   - Document integration points with existing services

4. **Technical Debt**
   - Review and update CSS for consistency
   - Optimize image assets
   - Implement lazy loading for service pages
   - Add proper meta tags for SEO

## Docker Configuration Updates
- Modified port mappings in docker-compose.yml to avoid conflicts with Render deployment:
  - MinIO: 9002:9000 (was 9000:9000)
  - Redis: 6380:6379 (was 6379:6379)
  - Prometheus: 9091:9090 (was 9090:9090)
  - Grafana: 3001:3000 (was 3000:3000)

## Important Notes
1. All new service pages should follow the established template structure
2. Maintain consistent naming conventions for files and directories
3. Keep service descriptions aligned with the AI capabilities documentation
4. Ensure all new pages have proper error handling and loading states
5. Follow the existing CSS variable system for styling

## Next Steps Priority
1. Complete remaining additional service pages
2. Implement proper navigation between all services
3. Add comprehensive documentation for new services
4. Test all service integrations
5. Optimize performance and loading times

## Branch Management
- All changes are being made on the main branch
- Changes are being pushed directly to GitHub without affecting Render deployment
- Ensure to pull latest changes before starting new work
