# SafetyManager Service Design Document

## Overview
The SafetyManager service is responsible for managing all safety-related aspects of the Physical Education Dashboard. It integrates with the Activity system to ensure safe participation in physical activities and provides real-time safety monitoring and incident management.

## Core Components

### 1. Risk Assessment System
- **Activity Risk Evaluation**
  - Risk level classification (Low, Medium, High)
  - Environmental factor analysis
  - Equipment safety checks
  - Student health considerations
  - Weather conditions (for outdoor activities)

- **Student Risk Profile**
  - Health history tracking
  - Physical limitations
  - Previous injuries
  - Current health status
  - Emergency contact information

### 2. Safety Monitoring
- **Real-time Monitoring**
  - Activity intensity tracking
  - Environmental condition monitoring
  - Equipment status checks
  - Student fatigue monitoring
  - Emergency situation detection

- **Alert System**
  - Risk threshold monitoring
  - Emergency alerts
  - Safety protocol reminders
  - Equipment maintenance alerts
  - Weather condition alerts

### 3. Incident Management
- **Incident Reporting**
  - Incident documentation
  - Severity classification
  - Response tracking
  - Follow-up procedures
  - Reporting to authorities

- **Emergency Response**
  - Emergency action plans
  - First aid procedures
  - Emergency contact notification
  - Facility evacuation procedures
  - Post-incident analysis

### 4. Safety Protocols
- **Pre-activity Safety Checks**
  - Facility inspection
  - Equipment verification
  - Student readiness assessment
  - Environmental safety check
  - Emergency equipment verification

- **Activity-specific Protocols**
  - Sport-specific safety rules
  - Equipment usage guidelines
  - Movement safety standards
  - Group management protocols
  - Emergency procedures

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Database Models
```python
class SafetyIncident(BaseModel):
    id: int
    activity_id: int
    student_id: int
    incident_type: str
    severity: str
    description: str
    response_taken: str
    reported_by: int
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime

class RiskAssessment(BaseModel):
    id: int
    activity_id: int
    risk_level: str
    factors: List[str]
    mitigation_measures: List[str]
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime

class SafetyAlert(BaseModel):
    id: int
    alert_type: str
    severity: str
    message: str
    recipients: List[int]
    created_at: datetime
    resolved_at: Optional[datetime]
```

### 2. API Endpoints
```python
# Risk Assessment
POST /api/v1/safety/risk-assessment
GET /api/v1/safety/risk-assessment/{activity_id}

# Incident Management
POST /api/v1/safety/incidents
GET /api/v1/safety/incidents
GET /api/v1/safety/incidents/{incident_id}
PUT /api/v1/safety/incidents/{incident_id}

# Safety Monitoring
GET /api/v1/safety/monitoring/{activity_id}
POST /api/v1/safety/alerts
GET /api/v1/safety/alerts

# Safety Protocols
GET /api/v1/safety/protocols
GET /api/v1/safety/protocols/{activity_type}
```

### 3. Service Integration
- **ActivityManager Integration**
  - Real-time activity monitoring
  - Risk assessment during activity planning
  - Safety protocol enforcement
  - Incident reporting integration

- **StudentManager Integration**
  - Health data access
  - Emergency contact information
  - Medical condition tracking
  - Safety clearance verification

- **Notification System Integration**
  - Emergency alerts
  - Safety reminders
  - Incident notifications
  - Protocol updates
