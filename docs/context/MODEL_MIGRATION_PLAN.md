# Faraday-AI Model Consolidation, Migration, and Rebuild Plan

## Overview

This document details the step-by-step process for consolidating, migrating, and rebuilding all model files in the Faraday-AI project. It is designed to serve as a living record of what has been done, what is in progress, and what remains, ensuring clarity and preventing confusion during this complex refactor.

## **Migration and Merge Plan**

### **Step 1: Identify Duplicates and Redundancies**
- Compare file contents (not just names) between all model directories.
- If a model already exists in `app/models/`, do NOT move the duplicateâ€”archive or delete the old one after verification.
- If a model is unique or contains unique logic, move it to `app/models/` and resolve any naming conflicts.

### **Step 2: Move Unique Models to `app/models/`**
- For each file in the legacy/service/dashboard directories:
  - If not already represented in `app/models/`, move it there.
  - If it is a utility or enum (e.g., `types.py`, `base.py`), merge its contents into the corresponding file in `app/models/`.

### **Step 3: Merge and Refactor as Needed**
- For files with overlapping content (e.g., multiple `class_.py`, `safety.py`, `exercise.py`):
  - Merge class definitions, enums, and utility functions into the canonical file in `app/models/`.
  - Preserve all relationships, constraints, and docstrings.
  - Remove or archive the old file after merging.

### **Step 4: Update Imports Throughout the Project**
- Update all import statements in:
  - Services
  - APIs
  - Tests
  - Seed scripts
- All model imports should now be from `app.models`.

### **Step 5: Verify and Test**
- Ensure all models are imported in `app/models/__init__.py` (for easy import in Alembic and elsewhere).
- Run Alembic autogenerate to verify all tables are detected.
- Run all tests and seed scripts to ensure nothing is broken.

### **Step 6: Archive or Delete Old Files**
- Once all tests and migrations pass, archive or delete the old model files/directories.

## **Stepwise Progress Tracking**

### **Completed**
- [x] Merged enums from `models/physical_education/types.py` into `app/models/types.py`
- [x] Updated `app/models/__init__.py` to import all enums
- [x] Created backup and removed legacy `types.py`
- [x] Compared and confirmed `base.py` in `app/models/` is canonical
- [x] Migrated all legacy physical education models
- [x] Migrated all service-specific models except generate_models.py, class_types.py, and routine_performance_models.py

### **In Progress**
- [x] Merged class_types.py into app/models/types.py
- [x] Merged routine_performance_models.py into app/models/routine_performance.py
- [x] Moved generate_models.py to app/models/utils/generate_models.py
- [ ] Review and consolidate dashboard models in app/dashboard/models/

### **Next Steps**
1. **Service-Specific/Legacy Models**
   - [ ] Complete remaining migrations for `generate_models.py`, `class_types.py`, and `routine_performance_models.py`
2. **Dashboard Models**
   - [ ] Move/merge as per table above
3. **Update Imports**
   - [ ] Update all import paths to use `app.models`
4. **Testing and Verification**
   - [ ] Ensure all models are imported in `app/models/__init__.py`
   - [ ] Run Alembic autogenerate and all tests
5. **Archive/Delete Old Files**
   - [ ] Archive or delete all old model files/directories after confirming everything works

---

## **Rules and Workflow**

- Always check the current working directory first
- Use absolute paths from the workspace root
- Verify file existence before creating, moving, or deleting files
- Move slowly and deliberately, one action at a time
- Wait for explicit user approval before each action
- Never create or edit files outside `Faraday-AI/app/models/`
- Never remove packages, dependencies, or requirements without approval
- Never overwrite or delete files without backup and user confirmation

---

## **Current Step**

- Preparing to review and merge `safety.py` from legacy to canonical location.
