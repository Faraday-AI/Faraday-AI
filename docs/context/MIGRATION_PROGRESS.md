7. **SQLAlchemy model conflicts** - Resolved import and relationship issues
8. **Base class consistency** - Updated all models to use SharedBase
9. **Import path updates** - Fixed all service and test imports
10. **Relationship definitions** - Resolved foreign key and back_populates issues
11. **Schema conflicts** - Fixed table name conflicts with extend_existing=True
12. **Type consistency** - Updated JSONB to JSON for SQLite compatibility

### ðŸš€ **Migration Complete**
The model migration is now stable and ready for next phase development. All models are properly integrated and tested with comprehensive test coverage.
