## ðŸ”„ REMAINING MIGRATION WORK

### High Priority:
1. **Fix remaining test imports** and get all tests passing (PE, Core, Integration, Model tests)
2. **Implement data persistence** in PE services (replace TODO placeholders)
3. **Complete dashboard export functionality** (CSV/PDF export, share links)

### Medium Priority:
1. **Implement real API integrations** (LMS, Calendar, Translation services)
2. **Complete advanced analytics features** (pattern analysis, AI insights)
3. **Add geographic routing** for load balancing

### Low Priority:
1. **AI-driven features** (career recommendations, insights)
2. **Performance optimizations** (response time, cache efficiency)
3. **Advanced pilot features** (phone usage tracking, academic metrics)

## ðŸ“ˆ RECENT MIGRATION FIXES

### Dashboard System Fixes:
- âœ… Fixed ResponseValidationError in access control tests
- âœ… Added missing permission_type field to mock objects
- âœ… Fixed role hierarchy update tests
- âœ… Resolved permission inheritance test issues
- âœ… Fixed datatype mismatches for role IDs

### PE System Fixes:
- âœ… Resolved circular import issues between auth modules
- âœ… Created separate auth_models.py to avoid circular dependencies
- âœ… Fixed User model mismatches between core and API layers
- âœ… Updated all auth imports to use correct models
- âœ… Added missing auth functions (get_current_admin_user, authenticate_user, etc.)
- âœ… Fixed hardcoded secrets to use environment variables
