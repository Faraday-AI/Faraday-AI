## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x
2. Virtual environment (venv)
3. Git (for version control)
4. Terminal/Command Prompt
5. Code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Installation Steps
1. Open Terminal/Command Prompt

2. Navigate to your projects directory:
   ```bash
   # On macOS/Linux
   cd ~/Projects/New\ Faraday\ Cursor/Faraday-AI
   
   # On Windows
   cd "C:\Path\To\Projects\New Faraday Cursor\Faraday-AI"
   ```

3. Clone the repository (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Faraday-AI/Faraday-AI.git
   cd Faraday-AI
   ```

4. Create and activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

5. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Server
1. Ensure you're in the project root directory:
   ```bash
   # Check current directory
   pwd  # On macOS/Linux
   cd   # On Windows
   
   # Should show: /Path/to/Faraday-AI
   ```

2. Ensure virtual environment is activated:
   ```bash
   # Should show (venv) at start of prompt
   # If not, activate it using step 4 from Installation
   ```

3. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

4. Server access points:
   - Main URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000
   - API documentation: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
   - Alternative docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc
   - Landing page: http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/index.html

5. To stop the server:
   - Press CTRL+C in the terminal
   - Server will gracefully shut down

### Troubleshooting
1. If "command not found":
   - Ensure you're in the correct directory
   - Verify virtual environment is activated
   - Try reinstalling dependencies

2. If port is in use:
   - Change port: `python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001`
   - Or find and stop the process using port 8000

3. If modules not found:
   - Verify you're in project root directory
   - Confirm all dependencies are installed
   - Try deactivating and reactivating virtual environment
