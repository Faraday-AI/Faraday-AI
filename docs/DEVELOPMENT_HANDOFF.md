# Development Handoff - January 2025

## Current Status

### Working Directory
`/Users/joemartucci/Projects/New Faraday Cursor/Faraday-AI`

### Current Task
Fixing test failures in the physical education module, specifically addressing a mismatch between service implementation and test expectations.

### Last Command Executed
```bash
docker-compose exec app python -m pytest tests/physical_education/test_activity_cache_manager.py::test_get_cached_activity_found -v
```

## Current Issue

### Problem Description
The `ActivityCacheManager` service currently implements an in-memory cache (`self._cache = {}`), but the corresponding tests expect Redis functionality. This creates a `ModuleNotFoundError` when tests attempt to import Redis-related modules.

### Error Details
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app.services.physical_education.services.activity_cache_manager.redis'
```

### Files Involved
- **Service**: `app/services/physical_education/services/activity_cache_manager.py`
- **Tests**: `tests/physical_education/test_activity_cache_manager.py`

## User Requirements

### Explicit Instructions
The user has clearly stated: **"no we are in development , fix redis"**

This means:
- Implement Redis caching in the `ActivityCacheManager` service
- Do NOT modify the tests to work with in-memory cache
- Keep the tests as they are (expecting Redis functionality)

### Development Rules
- All files must be in Faraday-AI directory
- Running on local server, Docker and Render
- In development mode - prefer real implementations over mocks
- Never remove services if compatibility issues exist
- Ask permission before creating/editing files
- Take ONE action at a time and wait for explicit approval

## Environment Configuration

### Docker Setup
- Application running in Docker Compose
- Redis URL: `redis://localhost:6379/1` (configured in conftest.py)
- Test environment variables configured in `conftest.py`

### Test Environment
- Environment variables set in `pytest_configure` hook
- `TEST_MODE=true`
- `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///:memory:`
- `REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/1`

## Previous Work Completed

### Successfully Fixed
- All tests in `test_activity_manager.py` now pass
- Switched from mocked database sessions to real database sessions
- Environment variable issues resolved for individual test runs

### Test Status
- Dashboard tests: 160/160 passing ✅
- PE system: Fully functional ✅
- Authentication: Complete with JWT ✅
- Database: 360 tables seeded and operational ✅

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate Action
1. Implement Redis caching in `ActivityCacheManager`
2. Ensure proper Redis connection handling
3. Update service to use Redis operations instead of in-memory dict
4. Verify tests pass with new Redis implementation

### Implementation Requirements
- Use Redis for caching operations
- Maintain existing service interface
- Handle Redis connection failures gracefully
- Follow established patterns in the codebase

## Technical Context

### Cache Manager Documentation
Reference: `docs/context/cache_manager.md`
- Supports both Redis and in-memory caching
- Automatic fallback to in-memory when Redis unavailable
- Performance monitoring and connection pooling
- Advanced eviction strategies

### Activity System
Reference: `docs/context/activity_system.md`
- 44 activities across 20 categories
- Comprehensive physical education system
- Multiple difficulty levels and equipment requirements

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 (Current)
- [ ] Redis implemented in ActivityCacheManager
- [ ] All ActivityCacheManager tests passing
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Phase 2 (Next)
- [ ] Continue fixing remaining test failures
- [ ] Address any additional Redis-related issues
- [ ] Ensure full test suite stability

## Support Resources

### Key Documentation
- `docs/HANDOFF_DOCUMENT.md` - Complete system handoff
- `docs/testing/TESTING.md` - Testing framework status
- `docs/PROJECT_STATUS_SUMMARY.md` - Overall project status
- `docs/context/cache_manager.md` - Cache manager implementation details

### Working Commands
```bash
# Check system status
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/v1/phys-ed/health | jq .

# Run specific test
docker-compose exec app python -m pytest tests/physical_education/test_activity_cache_manager.py::test_get_cached_activity_found -v

# Run all PE tests
docker-compose exec app python -m pytest tests/physical_education/ -v
```

## Notes for Next Agent

### Critical Points
1. **User explicitly wants Redis implementation** - do not modify tests to work with in-memory cache
2. **Follow established rules** - ask permission before changes, work in Faraday-AI directory only
3. **Build on solid foundation** - core systems are working, focus on specific Redis implementation
4. **Maintain professionalism** - listen carefully to user instructions without making assumptions

### Environment Verification
- Verify Redis is available at `redis://localhost:6379/1`
- Check Docker Compose is running
- Confirm test environment variables are set correctly
