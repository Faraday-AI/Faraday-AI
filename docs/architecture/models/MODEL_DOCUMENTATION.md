## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
1. Table Names
   - Use domain prefix (e.g., `pe_`, `user_management_`)
   - Use plural form
   - Use snake_case

2. Field Names
   - Use snake_case
   - Be descriptive and clear
   - Use consistent patterns

### Relationships
1. Foreign Keys
   - Name: `{table_name}_id`
   - Type: UUID or Integer
   - Include appropriate constraints

2. Many-to-Many
   - Use junction tables
   - Name: `{table1}_{table2}`
   - Include timestamps

### Validation
1. Field Constraints
   - Use appropriate types
   - Set length limits
   - Add check constraints

2. Data Integrity
   - Use foreign key constraints
   - Set cascade behavior
   - Add unique constraints

### Documentation
1. Model Documentation
   - Clear purpose statement
   - Field descriptions
   - Relationship documentation
   - Validation rules

2. Code Documentation
   - Type hints
   - Docstrings
   - Usage examples
