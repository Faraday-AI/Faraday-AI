# Model ID Standardization Technical Documentation

## Overview
This document details the technical changes made to standardize all model primary keys and foreign keys to use Integer type across the codebase.

## Affected Models

### Security Models
1. APIKey
   - Location: `app/models/security/api_key.py`
   - Changes: Primary key changed from String to Integer

2. RateLimit and Related Models
   - Location: `app/models/security/rate_limit/rate_limit.py`
   - Affected Models:
     - RateLimit
     - RateLimitPolicy
     - RateLimitMetrics
     - RateLimitLog
   - Changes: All primary and foreign keys changed to Integer

### Physical Education Models
1. Base Models
   - Location: `app/models/physical_education/base/physical_education.py`
   - Changes: Primary keys standardized to Integer

2. Student Models
   - Location: `app/models/physical_education/student/health.py`
   - Changes: Primary and foreign keys updated to Integer

3. Exercise Models
   - Location: `app/models/physical_education/exercise/models.py`
   - Changes: All IDs standardized to Integer

4. Movement Analysis Models
   - Location: `app/models/physical_education/movement_analysis/models.py`
   - Changes: Primary and foreign keys updated to Integer

5. Environmental Models
   - Location: `app/models/physical_education/environmental.py`
   - Changes: All IDs changed to Integer

## Technical Details

### Database Considerations
- All migrations should be reviewed for compatibility
- Existing data may need to be migrated
- Foreign key constraints should be verified

### Code Changes
1. Primary Key Changes
   ```python
   # Before
   id = Column(String, primary_key=True, index=True)
   
   # After
   id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
   ```

2. Foreign Key Changes
   ```python
   # Before
   rate_limit_id = Column(String, ForeignKey("rate_limits.id"), nullable=False)
   
   # After
   rate_limit_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("rate_limits.id"), nullable=False)
   ```

### Testing Requirements
1. Unit Tests
   - Update all test fixtures to use integer IDs
   - Verify foreign key relationships
   - Test CRUD operations with new ID type

2. Integration Tests
   - Verify API endpoints work with integer IDs
   - Test data serialization/deserialization
   - Check database constraints

## Migration Guide

### For Developers
1. Update test data to use integer IDs
2. Review and update any hardcoded ID references
3. Verify foreign key relationships in your code
4. Test all affected endpoints

### For Database Administrators
1. Review existing migrations
2. Plan data migration strategy
3. Verify database constraints
4. Test performance impact

## Known Issues
- None currently identified

## Future Considerations
1. Monitor database performance
2. Review indexing strategy
3. Consider impact on API versioning
4. Plan for potential scaling needs
