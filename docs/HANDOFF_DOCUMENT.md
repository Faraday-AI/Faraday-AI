### üîµ LOW PRIORITY (Complete Last)

#### 1. AI-Driven Features
**Location:** Various service files
**Features to Implement:**
- Career recommendations (`app/core/career/`)
- Case insights (`app/core/guidance/`)
- Pattern analysis (`app/services/analytics/`)

#### 2. Performance Optimizations
**Location:** Throughout the codebase
**Optimizations Needed:**

- Complete dashboard exports (user-facing features)

### 3. Use the Working Foundation:
- The core system is solid and production-ready
- Build upon the existing working infrastructure
- Follow the established patterns and conventions

### 4. Test Everything:

- `app/dashboard/tests/` - Working test examples
- `app/services/physical_education/` - PE system services
- `app/core/auth.py` - Authentication system
- `docker-compose.yml` - Environment configuration

### Common Issues and Solutions:

## üéâ GOOD LUCK!

You're inheriting a solid, working foundation. The core systems are complete and production-ready. Focus on completing the enhancement features systematically, and you'll have a fully-featured educational platform.

**Remember:** The system is already functional - you're adding polish and advanced features, not fixing broken core functionality.
