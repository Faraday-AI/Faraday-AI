## Recent Changes (Model ID Standardization)

### Overview
We have completed a comprehensive update to standardize all model primary keys and foreign keys to use Integer type across the codebase. This change ensures consistency and improves database performance.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Core Models Updated
- APIKey (app/models/security/api_key.py)
- RateLimit and related models (app/models/security/rate_limit/rate_limit.py)
- All models in app/models/physical_education/*

#### 2. Key Changes
- Changed all String primary keys to Integer
- Updated all foreign key references to use Integer
- Removed unnecessary index=True flags where present
- Maintained existing relationships and constraints
- Added extend_existing=True where needed to prevent table conflicts

#### 3. Models Already Using Integer (No Changes Needed)
- Curriculum models
- Goal Setting models
- Voice model
- Some Physical Education base models

### Testing Considerations
- All test data should now use integer IDs
- Test fixtures may need updating to use integer IDs
- Foreign key relationships should be verified in tests

### Next Steps
1. Verify all migrations are working correctly
2. Update any remaining test fixtures
3. Test all foreign key relationships
4. Verify data integrity in existing databases

### Important Notes
- All changes were made within the Faraday-AI directory
- Existing directory structure was maintained
- Established patterns were followed
- No services were removed due to compatibility issues
