# Service/Subservice Cleanup Inventory

## Physical Education Service

### Current Locations:
1. `services/phys-ed-teacher.html` (main service file)
2. `services/services_subpages/phys-ed/` (newer files)
3. `services/services_subpages/phys-ed-teacher/` (additional content)

### Merge Plan:

#### Step 1: Directory Structure
1. Keep main service file:
   - `services/phys-ed-teacher.html` âœ“

2. Primary directory:
   - `services/services_subpages/phys-ed/` (main directory)

3. Additional content to merge:
   - `services/services_subpages/phys-ed-teacher/`
     - Subdirectories:
       - `resource-integration/`
       - `content-sequencing/`
       - `activity-design/`
       - `curriculum-alignment/`
     - HTML files:
       - `analytics.html`
       - `differentiated-instruction.html`
       - `drivers-education.html`
       - `health-education.html`
       - `skill-development.html`
       - `resource-generation.html`
       - `ai-customization.html`
       - `curriculum-input.html`
       - `student-progress.html`
       - `skill-evaluation.html`
       - `assessment-tools.html`
       - `game-design.html`

#### Step 2: Merge Process
1. First Phase - Subdirectories:
   - Move `resource-integration/` to `phys-ed/`
   - Move `content-sequencing/` to `phys-ed/`
   - Move `activity-design/` to `phys-ed/`
   - Move `curriculum-alignment/` to `phys-ed/`

2. Second Phase - HTML Files:
   - Compare and merge content with existing files
   - Keep newer versions where applicable
   - Preserve unique content from both directories

3. Third Phase - Cleanup:
   - Remove empty directories
   - Update any internal links
   - Verify all content is accessible

### Progress Tracking:
