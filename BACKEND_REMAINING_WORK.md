## ⚠️ Critical - Needs Implementation

### 1. No Database Migrations Needed

All 13 required tables are already present in the database (verified October 28, 2025).

### 2. Update get_current_user Dependency (If Needed)

Verify that `get_current_user` in `app/core/auth.py` returns `TeacherRegistration` model properly for beta system.

## 📝 Nice to Have

### 4. Integration Tests

Create `test_beta_dashboard_endpoints.py`:

```python
# Test all dashboard endpoints
def test_get_dashboard():
def test_update_dashboard():
def test_get_dashboard_widgets():
# ... etc
```

### 5. Update Documentation

- [ ] Update `BETA_API_ENDPOINTS_COMPLETE.md` with new dashboard endpoints
- [ ] Update `docs/BETA_SYSTEM_HANDOFF.md` with implementation status
- [ ] Add OpenAPI/Swagger examples for new endpoints

### 6. Error Handling

- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling in service methods
- [ ] Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- [ ] Add logging for debugging

### 7. Performance

- [ ] Add database indexes on frequently queried columns
- [ ] Implement caching for widget/avatar lookups
- [ ] Optimize N+1 query issues

## 🚀 Recommended Order of Work

1. **Add service method stubs** (1-2 hours)
   - Return placeholder dict data for now
   - Make sure all endpoints work even with dummy data

2. **Create database migrations** (30 minutes)
   - Create the tables
   - Test migrations

3. **Test in Docker** (15 minutes)
   - Verify all endpoints work
   - Test with actual data

4. **Implement full service logic** (Ongoing)
   - Start with critical methods
   - Add features incrementally

5. **Integration tests** (1-2 hours)
   - Comprehensive endpoint testing
   - Edge case handling
