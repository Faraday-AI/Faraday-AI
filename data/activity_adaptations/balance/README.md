# Balance Adaptations

This directory contains adaptations for balance exercises. Each file represents a specific exercise with modifications for different stability levels and needs.

## Common Adaptations

1. **Static Balance**
   - Wider base of support
   - Use of support
   - Reduced duration
   - Modified positions

2. **Dynamic Balance**
   - Slower movements
   - Shorter distances
   - Additional support
   - Simplified patterns

3. **Reactive Balance**
   - Reduced challenge
   - Controlled environment
   - Increased support
   - Gradual progression

## Safety Considerations

- Always have support nearby
- Start with simple exercises
- Progress gradually
- Consider surface stability
- Monitor fatigue levels

## Equipment Adaptations

Common equipment used in balance adaptations:
- Balance boards
- Stability balls
- Handrails
- Mats
- Cones for visual guidance
