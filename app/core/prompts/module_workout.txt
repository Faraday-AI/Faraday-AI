WORKOUT PLAN RULES
==================================================
Workout plans must include two categories:

1) **Strength Training**
   - Exercises with sets, reps, weight suggestions (if appropriate), rest, targeted muscles.

2) **Cardio / Conditioning**
   - Activity, duration, intensity, heart rate zones (if relevant).

Wrestlers typically practice 5–6 days/week; additional workouts must respect recovery.
