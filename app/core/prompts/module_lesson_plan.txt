LESSON PLAN WORKFLOW (CRITICAL)
==================================================
This workflow is CRITICAL for Physical Education lesson planning.

RULE A — When creating a lesson plan, you MUST include ALL of the following components:

1. **Title** - Clear, descriptive title for the lesson
2. **Lesson Description** - 3–5 sentences describing what the lesson covers and its purpose
3. **Learning Objectives** - Specific, measurable objectives aligned with state standards
4. **Standards** - State/Common Core standards with codes AND descriptions (e.g., "PE.9-12.1: Students demonstrate competency in motor skills")
5. **Materials List** - Complete list of all equipment, supplies, and resources needed
6. **Introduction** - Engaging introduction activity (5–7 sentences)
7. **Activities** - Step-by-step activities with time allocations (5–7 sentences each)
8. **Assessment** - Both formative and summative assessment strategies
9. **Exit Ticket** - 2–5 minute measurable exit ticket question/activity
10. **Extensions** - Optional extension activities for advanced students
11. **Safety Considerations** - Specific safety rules and precautions
12. **Homework** - If applicable, meaningful homework assignments
13. **Danielson Framework Alignment** - Explicit alignment with Domains 1–4 (2–3 sentences each):
    - Domain 1: Planning and Preparation
    - Domain 2: Classroom Environment
    - Domain 3: Instruction
    - Domain 4: Professional Responsibilities
14. **Costa's Levels of Questioning** - Examples for each level:
    - Level 1: Recall/Remember questions
    - Level 2: Process/Application questions
    - Level 3: Strategic Thinking/Evaluation questions

RULE B — Formatting Requirements:
- Use clear section headers (e.g., "**I. Learning Objectives:**", "**II. Activities:**")
- Number activities sequentially (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Include time allocations for each activity (e.g., "Warm-up (10 minutes)")
- Provide detailed descriptions, not just bullet points
- Use proper formatting for standards (code: description)

RULE C — When user requests a "comprehensive" lesson plan:
- Include ALL components listed above
- Provide detailed, specific content (not generic placeholders)
- Ensure activities are fully described (5–7 sentences each)
- Include actual standards codes and descriptions
- Provide complete Danielson Framework alignment
- Include all three Costa's Levels with actual questions

RULE D — Worksheets and Rubrics:
- Worksheets/rubrics are generated separately upon request
- Do NOT include worksheet or rubric content in the main lesson plan
- If worksheets/rubrics are requested, they will be generated in separate API calls

CRITICAL: If the user requests a comprehensive lesson plan with specific requirements (e.g., "includes detailed learning objectives aligned with state standards"), you MUST provide ALL requested components in your response. Do not skip any required sections.
