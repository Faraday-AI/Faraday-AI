## üöÄ How to Run Phase 2 Seeding

### Prerequisites
- Phase 1 seeding must be completed first
- Database must be running and accessible
- All required models must be imported and tables created

### Running the Script

#### Option 1: Direct Execution
```bash
cd /Users/joemartucci/Projects/New\ Faraday\ Cursor/Faraday-AI
python app/scripts/seed_data/seed_phase2_educational_system.py
```

#### Option 2: Import and Run
```python
from app.scripts.seed_data.seed_phase2_educational_system import seed_phase2_educational_system
from app.core.database import SessionLocal

session = SessionLocal()
try:
    results = seed_phase2_educational_system(session)
    session.commit()
    print("Phase 2 seeding completed successfully!")
    print(f"Total records created: {sum(results.values()):,}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Phase 2 seeding failed: {e}")
    session.rollback()
finally:
    session.close()
```

#### Option 3: Integration with Main Seeding Script
Add the Phase 2 seeding to your main seeding orchestrator:

```python
# In your main seeding script
from app.scripts.seed_data.seed_phase2_educational_system import seed_phase2_educational_system

# After Phase 1 is complete
print("Starting Phase 2: Educational System Enhancement...")
phase2_results = seed_phase2_educational_system(session)
session.commit()
print("Phase 2 completed successfully!")
```

## üìä Expected Results

### Total Records Created
- **Section 2.1**: ~7,000+ records
- **Section 2.2**: ~2,000+ records  
- **Section 2.3**: ~400+ records
- **Total Phase 2**: ~9,400+ records

### Tables Populated
- **Phase 1**: 138 tables (already completed)
- **Phase 2**: 38 tables (this script)
- **Total After Phase 2**: 176 tables
- **Remaining**: ~280 tables for future phases

## üîç Verification

After running Phase 2, you can verify the seeding by:

1. **Checking record counts**:
```sql
SELECT 'pe_lesson_plans' as table_name, COUNT(*) as record_count FROM pe_lesson_plans
UNION ALL
SELECT 'lesson_plan_activities', COUNT(*) FROM lesson_plan_activities
UNION ALL
SELECT 'curriculum_lessons', COUNT(*) FROM curriculum_lessons;
```

2. **Running the existing check script**:
```bash
python app/scripts/seed_data/check_table_structure.py
```

3. **Manual verification**:
```python
from app.core.database import SessionLocal
from sqlalchemy import text

session = SessionLocal()
try:
    result = session.execute(text("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pe_lesson_plans"))
    count = result.scalar()
    print(f"PE Lesson Plans: {count} records")
finally:
    session.close()
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Dependencies
- **Phase 1 must be complete** - All foundation tables must exist
- **Users and teachers must exist** - The script assumes certain IDs exist
- **Database connection** - Must have proper database access

### Error Handling
- The script includes comprehensive error handling
- Each table seeding is wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Failed seeding doesn't stop the entire process
- Detailed logging shows which tables succeeded/failed

### Data Quality
- All data is realistic and follows educational domain patterns
- Foreign key relationships are properly maintained
- Timestamps are realistic (past dates for historical data)
- Randomization ensures variety in the data

### Performance
- Batch inserts for efficiency
- Progress indicators for long-running operations
- Transaction management for data consistency

## üîÑ Next Steps

After Phase 2 completion:

1. **Verify all 38 tables are populated**
2. **Check referential integrity**
3. **Test application functionality**
4. **Plan Phase 3** (Health & Fitness System - 52 tables)
5. **Update progress documentation**

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the error logs for specific table failures
2. Verify Phase 1 completion status
3. Ensure all required models are imported
4. Check database connection and permissions
5. Review the table structure for any schema changes
