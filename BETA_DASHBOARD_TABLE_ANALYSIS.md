## Decision Needed

You said "if anything the tables exist and just need to be renamed". 

**Questions:**
1. Should we **reuse existing tables** instead of creating new ones?
2. Should we **rename my models** to match existing tables?
3. Should we **create the missing tables** as new beta-specific tables?

**Recommendation:**
Since this is a **Beta Teacher Dashboard** designed to work separately from the main system, I recommend:
- Keep the 11 new tables as **beta-specific**
- They won't conflict with existing tables
- Creates clear separation between beta and main system

**OR if you want to reuse existing tables:**
- We need to update the models to use existing table names
- This would remove the separation between beta and main systems

What would you prefer?
