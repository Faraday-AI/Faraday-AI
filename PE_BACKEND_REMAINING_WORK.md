## üéØ Recommendation

**Before starting Beta Frontend:**

1. **Assess if PE Assistant backend is critical** for immediate release
2. **Prioritize which features** must work for minimum viable product
3. **Estimate realistic timeline** for completing remaining work
4. **Consider parallel development** if Beta Frontend doesn't depend on PE Assistant

**Options:**
- Option A: Complete all PE Assistant work (18-25 days)
- Option B: Focus on critical features only (7-10 days)
- Option C: Defer PE Assistant work, focus on Beta Frontend
- Option D: Hire additional developers for parallel work

---

## üìù Conclusion

The Physical Education Assistant backend has **significant work remaining**:
- 240 tests need fixing (22% failure rate)
- Multiple critical services missing
- Database schema issues to resolve
- Estimated 18-25 days of work

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT READY** for frontend development

**Next Steps:** Decide on priority and timeline before proceeding.
